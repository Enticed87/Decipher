Deciphercoin
================================


What is Deciphercoin?
----------------

OK to be completely honest I have minimal to basic developing/coding skills, the result is a coin I created over 1 year ago but never released, I mined some here and there for some periods of time to see if it worked properly and it did, then I had no time spare so I put it on the things to do list.

Now the time has come to release it but with a different kind of Launch.

Deciphercoin will be a Partly-Free Distributed Cryptocurrency with its primary goals relying on the community so everyone can lend a hand for a reward (Bounty) & get involved.

The initial Free Distribution details, wallets & source code will be announced but no node will be given until official release, so even if you did get it to work you would be mining on the wrong Official chain.

Yes that's right, you will pay absolutely nothing for your Initial Free coins.
